# Time Series Transformer Forecast — Example Project

## Overview
This repository shows how to build, train, and evaluate a Transformer-based forecasting model using PyTorch and Streamlit. It focuses on:
- attention mechanisms, positional encoding
- preparing time-series for transformer input (sliding windows)
- encoder/decoder style forecasting
- training, evaluation, visualization and basic Streamlit UI

The dataset is downloaded automatically using `kagglehub`.

## Quickstart (local)
1. Install Python 3.11.0 and create a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
